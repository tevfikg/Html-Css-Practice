            <h2>Geography and the Volcanic Landscape</h2>
            <p>Santorini is part of the Cyclades group of islands and is actually the remnant of a massive volcanic
                eruption
                that occurred around 1600 BCE, which shaped its unique crescent shape. The eruption created a large
                caldera
                (a sunken volcanic crater), which is now filled with the deep blue waters of the Aegean. The cliffs that
                rise steeply from the sea give the island its dramatic landscape, which is dotted with picturesque
                villages.
